Local 31 checking in. I'm sorry for the hour. After the day I had (combined with the issues of my personal life) I completely shutdown and passed out when I got home. Here's what I've got, and this is a *lot* , but please read it all and give this some thought:\n\n- My local has yet to put out anything official regarding ratification. Repeated communique with my BA throughout the day, but our PO has yet to say.\n\n- The Teamsters Canada website _has_ made an official announcement here: https://teamsters.ca/blog/2025/08/29/teamsters-canada-members-at-ups-accept-companys-final-offer/ \n- There is no official mention there regarding voting turnout, nor % in favour \n\n- In 2020 the previous CBA was ratified by a vote of 60.8% yes vote, over a turnout of approximately 53% of the voter base.\n-This is the 2019-2025 agreement results https://www.teamsters31.ca/news_bulletins/UPS-Canada-Contract-Ratified.pdf\n- This offer has supposedly been accepted by 63% voting yes, over a supposed turnout of 76%\n- A much larger turnout, but (speculatively speaking) the positive vote numbers are rather scarily similar \n- Allegedly, a driver in an Ontario depot was talking about the contract being ratified with the mentioned 63% yes vote, a full 32 hours *before the voting window was closed!* How could anyone possibly have that information before the entire vote, supposedly _totally secure_ had even completed? \n\n- Upper management has been caught (red handed, across the country) of exhibiting unfair and illegal practices around voter manipulation and interference. Directly asking (and recording a paper trail of results) who was voting which way, retaliation against stewards for little to no reason, and against members for saying openly that they were against the offer \n- Setting up voting stations using UPS computers, which are all connected to the UPS intranet, and only access the actual Internet after filtering traffic through their networks. We have no idea what control they have implemented on the back end of those networks.\n- Anything displayed has the opportunity to be suspect to having been altered, as is any information the user may believe they have entered could be charged to suit their (UPS) needs\n\n- Management was holding \"focus groups\" with employees who had specifically _less than 4 years of service_ \n- I personally had the pleasure of attending one of those groups on Tuesday morning last week. It was all just a slew of lies, obfuscation, and propaganda being read from a script. \n- I informed my BA of the time and place of the meeting, he opted to attend as well (or tried to)... He was kicked out, escorted off of the property, it was done quite visibly in front of our members.\n\n- Again to reiterate how the hell did a rather senior, unionized UPS employee have knowledge of the results 32+ hours before it was to be completed? This MASSIVELY implies the election was rigged. \n\nTLDR: Nope, read it all and let it sink in.\n\nI would like to call a video conference meeting for next weekend. I think some action needs to be taken.\n\nThank you for your time. \n\nSincerely,\n WHAMI (Local 31, Victoria, BC)","author":"upsstopbullying","score":3,"created_at":"2025-08-30T14:04:57.000Z","is_submitter":false,"has_citation":false}],"classification":{"isQuestion":true,"isContractRelated":true,"topics":["overtime"],"confidence":0.4571428571428572},"groundTruth":{"answer":null,"citations":[],"annotatedBy":null,"annotatedAt":null},"fetchedAt":"2026-01-20T19:23:43.942Z","version":"1.0.0"}
