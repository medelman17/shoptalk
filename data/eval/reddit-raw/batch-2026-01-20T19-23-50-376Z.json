Second was for a seniority violation of someone that I had more seniority for working over 100 hours two weeks in a row. At this point, the penalty pay loan is over 3000$. Over the last nine months I’ve been in contact with the union and nothing has moved. They keep telling me that they are not being seen. I quit UPS after two years last December and moved into a job in my actual degree field. Everything that I’ve researched has stated that because I filed the grievance while I was still working there they still owe me the grievance and penalty pay. My question is if the Stewart that is supposed to be handling, it isn’t getting anywhere, where else do I take it to get this taken care of. I have all the text messages and the copy of the grievances that were submitted and signed for by management. ",

Second was for a seniority violation of someone that I had more seniority for working over 100 hours two weeks in a row. At this point, the penalty pay loan is over 3000$. Over the last nine months I’ve been in contact with the union and nothing has moved. They keep telling me that they are not being seen. I quit UPS after two years last December and moved into a job in my actual degree field. Everything that I’ve researched has stated that because I filed the grievance while I was still working there they still owe me the grievance and penalty pay. My question is if the Stewart that is supposed to be handling, it isn’t getting anywhere, where else do I take it to get this taken care of. I have all the text messages and the copy of the grievances that were submitted and signed for by management. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I'm not physically at the hub to see, and even if I was, what am I supposed to do, go around and ask every person their seniority date? \n\nI was thinking about \"preemptively\" filing a grievance saying something like \"If any lower-seniority employees are working, I'd like to receive compensation.\"\n\nWould this work? Is there a better way to go about this? Should I include other hubs within a 50-mile radius of my hub?

As a result, we routinely have dozens of 9.5 grievances being filed every week, but it seems like management just doesn’t care. I don’t see how it makes sense for the company to pay multiple drivers $150-$200/hr in 9.5 grievances, rather than just putting a couple extra drivers on the road each day and paying them $30/hr.
