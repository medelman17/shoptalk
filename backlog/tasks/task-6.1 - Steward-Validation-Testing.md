## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Conduct validation testing with real union stewards to verify accuracy and usability.

## Implementation Steps
1. Recruit 3-5 stewards from different Locals:
   - Mix of job classifications
   - Different regions/supplements
   - Varying tech comfort levels
2. Prepare test scenario document:
   - 20 test queries covering common scenarios
   - Expected answers/citations for each
   - Edge cases and tricky questions
3. Conduct testing sessions:
   - Observe stewards using the app
   - Record accuracy of responses
   - Gather usability feedback
4. Verify response accuracy:
   - Compare answers to known correct citations
   - Flag any incorrect or missing citations
5. Iterate based on feedback:
   - Fix identified issues
   - Re-test problematic queries
   - Document any prompt improvements

## Test Query Categories
- Seniority questions
- Pay rate questions
- Leave/time off questions
- Discipline procedures
- Grievance procedures
- Safety regulations
- Schedule/bidding questions

## Success Criteria
- 95%+ queries return accurate, cited responses
- Stewards can complete test independently
- No major usability blockers
